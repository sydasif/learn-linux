HOWEVER,  since Ubuntu 18.04 ships with systemd-resolved by default (and it's bound to port 53), you'll want to perform a few extra steps:

First,  disable and stop systemd-resolved:

sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
Second, delete the existing /etc/resolv.conf file, as it's a symlink to ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
Create a new /etc/resolv.conf file with this:

echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
Install dnsmasq:

sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
After install, the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file should be present.  After any changes, you'll need to restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
If you want to keep both dnsmasq and the systemd-resolved stub-resolver enabled and running, there are some ways to do that listed HERE.
